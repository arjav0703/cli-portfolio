# CLI Portfolio
### Credits
- Neofetch (for system stats in neofetch command)
- Figlet (for CLI-Portfolio text)
- Cowsay (for design in cheese command)
### Overview
This is a CLI-styled portfolio that displays info about me. This is inspired by various projects on Highseas (https://highseas.hackclub.com)

### How it works?
It works by some if statements in Javascript. It is designed as a web application for easy access and is CLI-styled, NOT CLI-based.
